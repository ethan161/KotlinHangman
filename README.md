# Overview

This software uses Kotlin to create a solo hangman game experience.

I wrote this software to get a better understanding of the Kotlin language and practice my learning skills.

The program was written in Kotlin, with the Random Library accessed.

# Future Work

- One thing I would love to add is a bigger word bank. I found it tedious to add words manually, but couldn't find a list online that had the proper formatting for my program. I could either add a txt file reader to use an already existing data bank or manually add more words.
- I could have also added classes. Using those could make the program much simpler and create a more abstract project.
- There are one or two blocks of code that are slightly redundant. I could increase abstraction and write a function that iterates through my lists for me.
